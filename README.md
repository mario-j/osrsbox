# Margin Tracker

Keeps track of items bought/sold and calculates the profit margin from the transaction. Originally I built this app to keep track of profits for a game I played which is why the item drop down is populated by a JSON file with items found within the game. The JSON file can be found here https://www.osrsbox.com/osrsbox-db/items-complete.json and was parsed and inserted into the dropdown using JavaScript.

Built using Flask, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQLAlchemy.

Live Version coming soon
